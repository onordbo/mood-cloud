# Exploring Tech Module @ Hyper Island

We got a month to play around with random cool tech stuff at Hyper Island. What we eventually ended up with was a puffy thundercloud. The technology inside the cloud is a bunch of LED's, hooked up to an Arduino, check out the code to see how I simulated the thunder!
